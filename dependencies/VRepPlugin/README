* How to Run V-REP experiments *
* Instructions for Linux *

# Prepare V-Rep

1. Download and extract V-Rep to some folder
2. Copy the content of dependencies/VRepPlugin/vrep to the vrep install directory ($VREP), replacing the files
3. The plugin might have to be recompiled: cd $VREP/programming/v_repExtPluginJBot ; make
4. Place the scripts in dependencies/VRepPlugin side by side with $VREP
5. Make a jar with all the code and place it in the folder $VREP/programming/v_repExtPluginJBot/java/jbot.jar
* target package-for-store available in build.xml of the main NB project (the jar location might have to be adjusted in build.xml)

# Manage V-Rep workers

1. Update/send V-Rep to workers:
* Option A: ./copy_vrep.sh <worker_IP>
* Option B: ./copy_vrep_all.sh (The workers are loaded from the file zombies.sh)
* This should only be needed if there are major changes in the V-Rep distribution. The other stuff that typically changes with different experiments is sent every time the worker is started.
* The workers need to have installed: screen xvfb

2. To start workers:
* Option A: start each worker at a time, using for instance: ./start.sh <worker_IP> <number_of_cores> <scene_file.ttt> [repertoire_file.txt]
* Option B: start all workers: ./startall.sh <scene_file.ttt> [repertoire_file.txt] (The workers are loaded from the file zombies.sh)
* The script automatically continues running on the machine, restarting the workers every 2h because of memory leaks issues.

3. To stop workers:
* Option A: ./stop.sh <worker_IP>
* Option B: ./stopall.sh (Stops the workers specified in zombies.sh)


# Evolutionary process

1. Start workers, providing the scene file for the repertoire generation (such as hexapod_map.ttt or nao_map.ttt).
2. Adjust the vrep specific parameteres accordingly (see mase/vrep/vrep.params), specifying the workers
3. Adjust the evolutionary algorithm parameters (see mase/app/hexapod/vrep_hexapod.params for an example)
4. Launch the evolutionary process. Ex: ./evolve.sh -out vrep -p jobs=1 -p generations=100 -p parent=build/classes/mase/app/hexapod/vrep_hexapod.params -p parent=build/classes/mase/me/me.params)
5. Wait for magic to happen
