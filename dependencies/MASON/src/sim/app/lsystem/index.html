<h3>Quick Start</h3>Under the <tt>Rules </tt> tab, press the <tt>Calculate </tt> button.  Then start the simulation by pressing the <tt>Play </tt> button.

<h3>What is This?</h3>
Lindenmayer Systems (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindenmayer_system">L-systems</a>) are rule production systems which generate patterns common in plant structures and fractals.   tree structures and fractals) commonly seen. <a href="http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e28_3/lsys.html">More on L-Systems</a><br>

<h3>Usage</h3>
There are many examples available.  
<ul>
<li> Under the <tt>Rules </tt> tab, click <tt>Load </tt> to load a ruleset.  Example rulesets are located in the <tt>mason/sim/app/lsystem</tt> directory.  Alternatively, enter your own ruleset by hand.
<li> If you like, change the number of expansions and the initial seed, and click <tt>Calculate </tt> to expand the rules into the symbol string.
<li> If you like, under the <tt>Draw </tt> tab, change the angle and the distance (the length of each line), and press the <tt>Set </tt> button.
